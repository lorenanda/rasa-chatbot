## A Rasa chatbot for student support

Meet **Saige**, a chatbot designed to help the students of a Data Science bootcamp throughout their studies.
It has two main functionalities:
- answers organizational questions (e.g. how to submit assignments, what is the current schedule)
- runs a survey at the end of each week for students to answer questions about their learning experience (e.g. how interesting was the project, how many hours they worked, how helpful were the teachers). Their answers are recorded in a spreadsheet on Airtable.
